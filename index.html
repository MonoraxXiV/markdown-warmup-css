<p>You are in trouble or need a second pair of eyes. I might not always know the solution, but I will help you by
    searching around with you.
    If you need someone to talk to, I am always willing to lend an ear.</p>

<h5 id="a-funny-story">A funny story</h5>
<p>I met my boyfriend irl for the first time while I was cosplaying V from Devil may cry 5 at facts.
    Apparently we did meet before on final fantasy XIV where I proceeded to lecture him on the game for several hours.
    While doing a dungeon together. I made him his favourite class&#39; soulstone from the game for his birthday to
    remind him of it.</p>

Met boyfriend while in cosplay, impressed him by being a know-it all.
